  Our project is an interactive roguelike game. Players explore randomly generated dungeons,
  find cool items, and fight enemies using a precision weapon, large bombs. 
  Players will upgrade their character over the course of the game to make clearing 
  rooms easier. Players must carefully manage their supply of bombs and items 
  to survive the dungeon.
