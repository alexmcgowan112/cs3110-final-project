  Our project is an interactive roguelike game. Players can move their character between rooms
  find cool items, and fight enemies using a precision weapon, large bombs. 
  Players will be able to upgrade their character and fight increasingly difficult enemies 
  until they reach some arbitrary stat. Wooo.
